The **SOLID** principles are a set of five design principles that help software developers create more maintainable, scalable, and flexible code. They are especially important in object-oriented programming (OOP). Here's a brief explanation of each principle with a Java code example.

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

---

### 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

---

### 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

---

### 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use. Instead of one large interface, many small, specific interfaces are preferred.

---

### 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces). Abstractions should not depend on details, but details should depend on abstractions.

SOLID principles can make code more maintainable, scalable, and easier to understand.
